# FamilyMapServer
This is a project meant to be used as the backend of my project named FamilyMap.
I choose to run it using IntelliJ IDEA, and it automatically runs on port 4040 of your computer.
There are a few pieces of this code that I did not write myself, but the majority of it is.
The pieces that aren't mine are the "web" folder, and whatever gradle or pom files there are.
